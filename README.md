# Android & IOS App using Flutter

## Problem Statment:

*Using this web service: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com*
- /users
- /photos

Make an app consist of two taps:
- Users tab: The list of users should show the name and email of the user. Selecting the user will show new details screen with all others user’s details. 
- Photos tab: list of photos should show a photo thumbnail and photo title. The list of photos should be organized in sections using the “albumid” as the section title. Selecting photo will show the full screen image in new screen using the “url” attribute.
